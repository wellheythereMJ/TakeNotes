# TakeNotes
This application allows users to write, save, and delete notes to organize their thoughts and tasks efficiently. Utilizing Express.js for the back end, it stores and retrieves note data from a JSON file, ensuring seamless functionality.

To get started, simply open the application and click the link to access the notes page. From there, you can add new notes by filling in the title and text fields, then clicking the "Save Note" button. Existing notes can be edited or deleted with ease, providing a user-friendly experience.

This Note Taker application meets all technical requirements, including connecting the front end to the Express.js back end and ensuring error-free console operation. Explore the live application [here]() and view the code repository on GitHub [here](https://github.com/wellheythereMJ/TakeNotes).
